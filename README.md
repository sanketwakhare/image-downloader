### 02: Download photos from JSONPlaceholder and Save in folders

#### Problem Statement

On `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos` there are 5000 photos. 50 each in 100 albums.
The response contains the URL from where each photo can be downloaded.

You have to download all the photos and save them in respective folders.

> We can just download 2 photos each from albums 1-10 for demo purpose

#### Example

After download, the folder structure should look like this

```
/albums
    /1
        9e59da.png
        a4bc66.png
    /2
        9e59da.png
